## Lab Assignment 3: Processes

We continue to code the shell we started in the first lab assignment. We'll add the following
commands. Check the supplied shell to check the workings and exact sintax for the commands. (You
can use the help command, "command -?" or "command -help" to get help):

**uid** views (or changes) the process's credentials
**showvar** shows the value of an environment variable
**changevar** changes the value of an environment variable
**subsvar** changes one environmet variable for other
**uid** views (or changes) the process's credentials
**showvar** shows the value of an environment variable
**changevar** changes the value of an environment variable
**subsvar** changes one environmet variable for other
**showenv** shows the process environment
**fork** the shell does the fork system call and waits for its child to end
**exec** executes a program (with arguments) without creating a new process. It is not neccesary to
do the priority (@pri) nor the reduced environment (VAR1 VAR2..) parts
**jobs** lists background processes
**deljobs** deletes background processes from the list
**job** shows info on a background process. Can change it to foreground
********* For anything that is not a shell command, the shell will asume it is an external program (in
the **format for execution** described below) and will create a process to execute it
******* &** For anything that is not a shell command, the shell will asume it is an external program (in
the **format for execution** described below) and will create a process IN THE
BACKGROUND to execute it. The process will be added to the list of background
processes. (the & indicates execition in background, must not be passed to the program as a
argument).

### IMPORTANT:

We have to implement (same list type as we used before) a list of processes executing in the
background. For each process we must show

- Its PID
- Date and time of launching
- Status (FINISHED, STOPPED, SIGNALED or ACTIVE) (with return value/signal when
    relevant)
- Its command line
- Its priority

The shell commands **_jobs_** and **_deljobs_** , show and manipulate that list. Only processes launched
from the shell to execute in the background will be added to the list.


We insert processes in the list as ACTIVE. We should update, with the waitpid system call, the
status of processes before printing. Note that the waitpid system call reports status changes, not the
state itself, in fact, it only reports once a process finished.

```
pid_t waitpid (pid_t pid, int * wstatus, int options);
```
The parameter _wstatus_ ONLY has a meaninful value in the case waitpid returs the pid.

Priority (as it can change) should be obtained at the time of printing so it is not necessary to
store it it the list.

Execution in foreground means the parent process **waits** for the child to finish before
continuing.

Execution in the background means the parent continues to execute concurrently with the child:
i **t does not wait** for its child to finsh.

******* format for execution**

```
The format for creating process that executes a program is
```
**executable arg1 arg2......[&]**

items inside brackes [] are optional

- **executable** is the name of the executable file to be executed
- **arg1 arg2 ...** are the arguments passed to the executable. (number of them is undefined)
- **&** if present means that execution is to be in the background
- This format, with the execption of the &, is the same to be used with the **_exec_** command to
    execute without creating process

Examples
-> ls
executes, creating a process in the foreground, the program ls
-> ls -l -a /home
executes, creating a process in the foreground, 'ls -l -a /home '
-> xterm -fg yellow -e /bin/bash
executes, creating a process in the foreground, 'xterm -fg yellow -e /bin/bash'
**-> xterm -fg green -bg black -e /usr/local/bin/ksh &**
executes creating a process in the background 'xterm -fg green -bg black -e /usr/local/bin/ksh'
-> exec xterm -fg white
executes without creating a new process 'xterm -fg white'

We'll use the _setuid_ systemt call to change the user credential. Under normal circunstances the
real and effective credentials will be the same, so no changes in the proccess credentials are allowed.
To check this part of the lab assigment we'll have to

- Give the executable the setuid execution bit rwsr-xr-x (4755)


- Have it executed by another user so that the real credential is that of the user executing
    the file and the saved and efective credentials are those of the owner of the file. (It's a
    good idea to place the executable file on a writable directory for both of those users:
    /tmp. )
- The _setuid_ system calls behave direrently for the root user, son we must not use that
    account to check this part of the lab assigment)

### REMEMBER:

- Information on the system calls and library functions needed to code these programs is available
    through man: fork, exec, waitpid, getenv, putenv, getpriority,....
- A reference shell is provided (for various platforms) for students to check how the shell should
    perform. This program should be checked to find out the syntax and behaviour of the various
    commands. **PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE LATEST VERSION**
- The program should compile cleanly (produce no warnings even when compiling with **gcc -**
    **Wall)**
- These programs can have no memory leaks (you can use valgrind to check)
- When the program cannot perform its task (for whatever reason, for example, lack of privileges)
    it should inform the user
- All input and output is done through the standard input and output
- Errors should be trated as in the previous lab assignments
- An additional C file is provided with some useful functions

### WORK SUBMISSION

- Work must be done in pairs.
- Moodle will be used to submit the source code: a zipfile containing a directory named P
    where all the source files of the lab assignment reside
- The name of the main program will be p3.c, Program must be able to be compiled with gcc
    p3.c, Optionally a Makefile can be supplied so that all of the source code can be compiled with
    just make. Should that be the case, the compiled program should be called p
- ONLY ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP will submit the source code. The names
    and logins of all the members of the group should appear in the source code of the main
    programs (at the top of the file)
- Works submited not conforming to these rules will be disregarded.
- DEADLINE: 23:00, **THURSDAY December the 14th, 2023**
